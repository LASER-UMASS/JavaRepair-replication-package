RQ2: How often and how much do the patches produced by G&V techniques overfit to the developer-written test suite and fail to generalize to the evaluation test suite, and thus ultimately to the program specification?

To reproduce the results for RQ2, execute the command:

`bash reproduce-rq2.sh ../../../results/RQ2/patch-quality-assessment/`
