#The purpose of this script is to run Genprog in a particular defects4j bug.

#Preconditions:
#The variable D4J_HOME should be directed to the folder where defects4j is installed.
#The variable GP4J_HOME should be directed to the folder where genprog4java is installed.

#Output
#The output is a folder created in the $D4J_HOME/5thParameter/ where all the variants are stored including the patch, if any was found. 

#Input:
# 1st param is the project in upper case (ex: Lang, Chart, Closure, Math, Time)
# 2nd param is the bug number (ex: 1,2,3,4,...)
# 3th param is the option of running the test suite (ex: allHuman, oneHuman, oneGenerated)
# 4th param is the test suite sample size (ex: 1, 100)
# 5th param is the folder where the bug files will be cloned to. Starting from $D4J_HOME (Ex: ExamplesCheckedOut)
# 6th param is the initial seed. It will then increase the seeds by adding 1 until it gets to the number in the next param.
# 7th param is the final seed.
# 8th param is on if the purpose is to test only fault loc and not really trying to find a patch. When it has reached the end of fault localization it will stop.
# 9th param is the folder where the java 7 instalation is located
# 10th param is the folder where the java 8 instalation is located
# 11th param is set to \"true\" if negative tests are to be specified using sampled tests else set this to \"false\""
# 12th param is the path to file containing sampled negative tests"
# 13th param is set to \"true\" if positive tests are to be specified using sampled tests else set this to \"false\""
# 14th param is the path to file containing sampled positive tests"

#Example of usage:
#./runGenProgForBug.sh Math 2 allHuman 100 ExamplesCheckedOut 1 5 false /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.7.0-openjdk-amd64 /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-amd64 false \"\" false \"\"
