This folder contains the scripts used to run the statistical tests and generate plots
to address each of the following research questions. The scripts are organized in terms
of the research questions. 

RQ1: Do G&V techniques produce patches for real-world defects?
 
RQ2: How often and how much do the patches produced by G&V
techniques overfit to the developer-written test suite and fail to
generalize to the evaluation test suite, and thus ultimately to
the program specification?

RQ3: How do the coverage and size of the test suite used to produce
the patch affect patch quality?

RQ4: How does the number of tests that a buggy program fails
affect the degree to which the generated patches overfit?

RQ5: How does the test suite provenance (whether it is written by
developers or generated automatically) influence patch quality?

RQ6: Can overfitting be mitigated by exploiting randomness in the
repair process? Do different random seeds overfit in different
ways?
