#!/bin/bash

#The purpose of this script is to Create and Fix a test suite of a particular defects4j bug.

#Preconditions:
#There should be a folder called generatedTestSuites in the defects4j folder where the test suites and their output will be stored.
#The variable D4J_HOME should be directed to the folder where defects4j is installed.
#The variable JAVA_HOME should be directed to the folder where java 7 is installed (It must be Java 7).

#Output
#The output is a txt file with the output of testing the test suite on the folder indicated. The name of the txt file is: EvaluatingTestSuite"$PROJECT"-"$BUGNUMBER"f-evosuite-branch."$SEED".tar.bz2On"$LOWERCASEPACKAGE""$BUGNUMBER"BuggyOutput.txt and it is located in $D4J_HOME/generatedTestSuites/$IDENTIFIER/"$PROJECT"/evosuite-branch/"$SEED"/

#Input:
# 1st param is the project in upper case (ex: Lang, Chart, Closure, Math, Time)
# 2nd param is the bug number (ex: 1,2,3,4,...)
# 3th param is the generation tool (Randoop or Evosuite)
# 4th param is the budget of time in seconds the tool has to generate the test suite
# 5th param is weather you want to run only sections of the script: C=create, F=fix. You can run: CF, C, F
# 6th param is the name of the folder the test suite will be stored in. This is located in $D4J_HOME/generatedTestSuites/. Example: September21
# 7th param is the seed: 1
# 8th param is an optional patch file Example: /path/to/patch.txt

#Example of usage:
#./CFIndividual.sh Math 2 Evosuite 1800 CF September21 1
