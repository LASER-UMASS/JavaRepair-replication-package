`failingtestsdistribution.pdf` shows the distribution of failing tests in the 71 defects for which at least one repair technique produces at least one patch and has a high-quality evaluation test suite

`computePearson.log` shows the Pearson's product-moment correlation computed between the failing test count 
of the test suite used to guide the repair and the quality of the patch produced. 

`triggeringtest_corr_overall.pdf` shows linear regression between patch quality and the number of failing tests for each 
of the repair techniques.

**This replicates results described in Figure 7 of the paper.**
