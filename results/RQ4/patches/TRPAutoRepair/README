This folder contains patches generated by TRPAutoRepair for the experiment to answer the 
RQ: How does the number of tests that a buggy program fails affect the degree to which the 
generated patches overfit?

patch naming convention:

<defect>_<target-failingtest-count>_<data-point>_<seed>_<edit>.patch

for example, chart26_4_1_seed19_StmtReplace_239_105.patch

where, 
defect = chart26
target-failingtest-count = 4
data-point = 1
seed = 19
edit = StmtReplace_239_105
