This folder contains patches generated by GenProg for the experiment to answer the 
RQ: How does the number of tests that a buggy program fails affect the degree to which the 
generated patches overfit?

Only 2 out of 49 defects fixed by GenProg have sufficient number (>5) of failing tests 
to perform this experiment hence we run this experiment only for those defects (Chart 26 
and Closure 115). 

For each defect, we have 5 data-points uniformly distributed between 1 and #failing tests
and for each data-point we have 5 sets of failing tests sampled randomly. Following are 
the details of data-points for each defect. 

Chart 26, total #failing tests = 22, data-points = 4, 8, 13, 17, 22
Closure 115, total #failing tests = 7, data-points = 1, 2, 3, 5, 7

patch naming convention: <defect>_<data-point>_<sample>_neg_pos_<seed>_<variant details>.patch
for example, chart26_4_1_neg_pos_seed19_StmtReplace_239_105.patch
where, 
defect = chart26
data-point = 4
sample = 1
seed = 19
variant = StmtReplace_239_105
