`RQ3-results.log` shows the frequency distribution of the patched produced by each repair technique over the five programs. 
`gp_coverage_patchcount.pdf`, `par_coverage_patchcount.pdf`, and `trp_coverage_patchcount.pdf` plot these distributions. 
`RQ3-results.log` also shows the patch quality statistics for each of the repair techniques. 

`MLR.log` contains the results obtained by fitting a multi linear regression model to predict the quality 
of a patch produced by a repair tool based on the coverage of the test suite and the size of the test suite 
used to guide the repair tool. 

**This replicates results described in Figure 6 of the paper.**
