`RQ6-results.log` contains the statistics about the patch quality for each provenance, 
and the Mann-Whitney U test results comparing the patch quality of individual patches 
against the combined patches for the commonly patched defects for each of the three 
repair techniques. 

`gp_nversion_boxplot.pdf`, `par_nversion_boxplot.pdf`, and `trp_nversion_boxplot.pdf` 
show the boxplots comparing the quality of the individual patches against the combined ones 
for the in-common defects patched by GenProg, Par, and TRPAutoRepair respectively.

**This replicates results described in Figure 9 of the paper.**
