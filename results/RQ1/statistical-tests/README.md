`RQ1-results.log` shows the output obtained from the R script. It shows the total and 
the distribution of defects repaired by each of the three techniques (GenProg, TRPAutoRepair, and Par)
over the five programs. 

The files `gp_patchcount.pdf`, `par_patchcount.pdf`, and `trp_patchcount.pdf` are the plots generated 
for GenProg, Par, and TRPAutoRepair respectively using the data described in `RQ1-results.log`. 

**Above results replicate Figure 3 in the paper and the Research Question 1 results**
