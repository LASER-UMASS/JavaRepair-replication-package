`RQ1-results.log` shows the output obtained from the R script. It shows the total and 
the distribution of defects repaired by each of the four techniques (GenProg, Par, SimFix, and TrpAutoRepair)
over five programs. 

The files `gp_patchcount.pdf`, `par_patchcount.pdf`, `sim_patchcount.pdf`, and `trp_patchcount.pdf` are the plots generated 
for GenProg, Par, SimFix, and TrpAutoRepair respectively using the data described in `RQ1-results.log`. 

**This replicates results described in Figure 3 of the paper.**
